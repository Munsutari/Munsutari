- Hello, I’m @Munsutari,
- I do mostly python, though I have worked with lots of different languages.
- Currently I’m interested in and trying to learn neural networks and related topics.

---------

If you had a look at my code and didn’t immediately lose it, I do take requests for free if I’m interested enough.
Some enticement wouldn't hurt if you really wanted it though :P

Anything I do for free I’ll upload to a public rep so beware.
Don’t bother asking for anything too big or boring without any compensation.

Oh and you can use my code for anything you want. Do credit me if it is used in some major part tho, please.
Good Luck!
